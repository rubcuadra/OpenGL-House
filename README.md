# OpenGL-House
Created a house by loading obj files, the house consists of 3 scenes , a Garage, a room with stairs and bathroom and as well a kitchen

You can take a look to the files "comp", you'll need xcode(It includes OpenGL and GLUT frameworks) and as well with brew you can install the missing deps, which are: devil, jpeg, libpng.

To run it you can simply ./comp.sh or ./comp.fish since I use fish as main shell
